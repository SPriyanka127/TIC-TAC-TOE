# TIC-TAC-TOE
The Tic-Tac-Toe project is a game allowing two players to take turns in a 3x3 grid. Features include winning conditions, draw detection, and a reset option for a seamless gaming experience.
Grid Structure: The game provides a visually appealing grid layout, dividing the game area into nine clickable cells.

Player Interaction: Players can interact with the game by clicking on empty cells to place their respective marks ("X" or "O"). The alternating turns are managed by JavaScript.

Winning Condition: The game checks for winning conditions after each move. If a player successfully aligns three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, the game declares that player as the winner.

Draw Condition: If all cells are filled, and no player has won, the game declares a draw.

Reset Functionality: The "Reset Game" button allows players to start a new game, clearing the grid and resetting the turn order.

Styling: The project includes basic styling (handled by CSS) to make the game visually appealing.

Responsive Design: The project includes meta tags in the HTML for better responsiveness across different devices.
